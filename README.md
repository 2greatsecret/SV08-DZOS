# DZOS: Dynamic Z Offset and Soaking

**Latest: 0.1.41**

## GOAL:
1. Solve the SV08 bed and Z issues.
2. Dynamic Z offset based on current state of bed.
3. Dynamic pre-print soak time based on realtime bed sampling and size/duration of initial X layers.

## DISCLAIMER:
1. This is an early script, use your best judgment if it's right for you.
2. Currently supporting the stock SV08 klipper. Mainline should work but isn't thoroughly tested.
3. No dynamic soaking in latest. Custom macro available to define heat soak time before print.
